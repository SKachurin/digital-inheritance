## Introducing “The Digital Heir” Service
Our service provides a seamless, secure, and discreet way to ensure your most valuable digital assets and sensitive information are passed on to the right person, exactly when they need it—without ever revealing any details until the time is right.

## Why Choose Our Service?

1. **Complete Confidentiality**
    - No one will know you even have an inheritance or its amount.
    - No one will know who you have designated as your heir.
    - Your chosen heir themselves won’t know you’ve left anything for them, unless the time comes for them to access it.

2. **Independent of Local Laws**
    - We operate purely on a digital basis, independent of any regional or national legal procedures.
    - There is no need for official death certificates or complicated paperwork.
    - The process is solely between you and our service.

3. **Small Monthly Fee, Total Peace of Mind**
    - Your small monthly subscription guarantees constant coverage and monitoring.
    - If something happens to you, the service automatically handles the delivery process to your designated contact(s).

4. **Secure Encrypted Notes**
    - You create one encrypted note (or “secret envelope”) per account.
    - This note contains the sensitive data you want to pass on: passwords, addresses, private keys, login credentials—anything you choose.
    - It is stored securely on our servers in encrypted form, unreadable to anyone without the correct answers.

5. **Unlock via Personalized Questions**
    - You decide on up to four secret questions whose answers only you (and potentially your heir) know.
    - We give your heir two attempts (or multiple attempts, as you configure) to answer any one of these questions correctly (but preventing brute force of the password).
    - A correct answer decrypts the note; if the answer is wrong, the note remains locked.

## How “The Digital Heir” Works

1. **Automated Life Status Checks**
    - We periodically check your activity on selected social media platforms, send you WhatsApp messages, or email you to confirm you’re still active.
    - These checks happen at custom intervals that you set.

2. **Escalation Pipeline**
    - If you do not respond to the initial check within a designated timeframe, the system escalates to the next step.
    - You define the sequence of reminders—e.g., wait 24 hours, send a WhatsApp; if no response after another 8 hours, send an email; and so on.
    - If all attempts fail, the system automatically sends a secure link to your chosen heir(s).

3. **Release of the Encrypted Message**
    - Once the heir receives the secure link, they must answer the personalized questions you created.
    - Only if they answer correctly will your note be decrypted and revealed to them.
    - If they answer incorrectly, the information remains securely locked.

4. **No Heir Notification Needed**
    - You don’t have to inform anyone in advance.
    - Your heir can remain completely unaware until they receive the link—if it ever comes to that.

## Privacy & Security at Every Step

- **Encrypted Contacts**  
  Your contact details, along with those of your potential heirs, are encrypted before being stored on our servers. No one can access them without the proper keys.

- **Encrypted Secret Answers**  
  The answers to your security questions never leave your head in readable form. Once the message is encrypted, they are just deleted. We never save your security questions in our database.  
  Only you and your designated heir (who must guess the correct answers) can unlock your secret envelope.

- **No Selling of Data**  
  We do not watch you, track you, or sell your data to any third party. Your information and privacy remain strictly protected.

- **Independence from “Big Tech”**  
  Unlike large providers like Google or Apple, we do not require a death certificate or engage in lengthy corporate processes. Your data remains fully under your control, with no additional barriers.

## Setting Up Your Inheritance Pipeline

1. **Create Your Account**
    - Register with minimal personal information.
    - Pay the small monthly fee for continuous coverage.

2. **Enter Your Contacts**
    - Provide your own contact details (email, phone, messenger, social media) for life-status checks.
    - Optionally add multiple contact methods to minimize false triggers.

3. **Draft Your Encrypted Note**
    - Write down the message or credentials you want to pass on.
    - Set a personal security question and answer to encrypt the note.

4. **Add Your Heir(s)**
    - Input your heir’s contact details (email, phone, messenger, social media).
    - Create up to four unique questions (with corresponding answers) that only they would know.

5. **Design Your Notification Pipeline**
    - Specify the order and timing of checks and reminders (e.g., if no social media login for 7 days, then send an email; if no response in 24 hours, send a WhatsApp, etc.).
    - Once all attempts fail, the system will deliver a secure link to your heir.
