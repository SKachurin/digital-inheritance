  There are no limits to what you can enter here (though the field limit is 5000 characters). This could include crypto wallet credentials, online bank credentials, etc.
  This envelope will be encrypted with half of our security key and half of the hash from your answer to the security questions.
  As we never save your answers, once encrypted, only you and God will have the knowledge required to decrypt this note.
  We will never save your answers again—all decryption will be done on the fly from the answers you provide when accessing the note.

  introduction_text_1: |
    First things first — let's make it clear one more time: Everything you enter in this app is encrypted the moment you submit it, using a pretty strong protocol.
    This page will guide you through the entire setup process—just work your way down step by step.<br><br>
    We'll set up and verify your contacts so we can check your 'last online' status and send you messages if a check fails.
    Add and verify as many contacts as you need for your Pipeline constructor. But pay special attention to Social contacts, as they’re used to check your ‘last online’ status (which saves you from direct interactions through messengers). Whatever.<br>
    Also, pay attention to the text above and below form fields—we’ve tried to clearly state each field’s purpose. The base logic of this system is pretty simple:<br>
     - Verify your contacts. <br>
     - Add contacts for your Heir (no verification needed for them).<br>
     - Encrypt the Text.<br>
     - Choose how we check in on you (Pipeline).<br>

  more_security_spoiler: "More About Security"
  more_security_text: |
    In our DataBase everything is encoded except for your first email address. So, if our data were ever to ‘leak’ (which is highly unlikely), all they’d get is your first email address.<br>
    "The current implementation uses Sodium’s Secretbox with XSalsa20 for encryption and Poly1305 for authentication. This is a strong, secure, and widely trusted encryption method.
    It follows best practices by using XSalsa20-Poly1305, a robust nonce-based authenticated encryption scheme."<br><br>
    For encrypting your 'Envelope,' we combine a string from your answers with our secret. 
    Since your answers are never stored anywhere, each time you edit the ‘Envelope,’ you’ll need to decrypt it first.

  first_text: |
    Do you have any form of insurance? Think of this service as a way to ensure your digital assets end up in the right hands if something happens to you.
    Yes, it takes a bit of effort to set up and costs only a few dollars per month, but once everything is in place, we’ll continuously monitor your “last login” on the platforms you choose. If your inactivity exceeds the threshold you set, we’ll send a confirmation message to check in on you.
    If there’s still no response, your digital assets will be securely passed on to the contacts you designated.

  info_2_text: 'You have full control: decide how we monitor your activity, where and when you receive check-in messages, and the specific scenarios that trigger the release of your data to your heir. This way, your crypto wallets, exchange accounts, and offshore savings won’t vanish into the void, leaving no one to claim them.'

faq:
  title: 'FAQ'
  q1: 'What exactly is The Digital Heir Service, and how does it work?'
  a1: |
    The Digital Heir is a platform that safeguards your important digital information—such as login credentials, crypto wallet keys, or other sensitive data—in a secure, encrypted “note.” We periodically check your activity (via social media logins, WhatsApp, email, or whatever you configure). If you remain inactive past a certain threshold and don’t respond to our confirmation messages, we release a secure link to your designated heir. They can only unlock your information by correctly answering your secret questions.

  q2: 'Is my data safe? How do you ensure the security of my information?'
  a2: |
    Yes. All your data—along with the security questions and your heir’s contact details—is encrypted before it’s stored. We use robust encryption methods (XSalsa20-Poly1305) that require correct secret answers to decrypt your note. We never save your security answers themselves; they exist only in your memory. Once encrypted, your sensitive details remain locked until someone provides the correct answers.

  q3: 'Do I need to provide legal documents like a death certificate?'
  a3: |
    No. Our service is entirely independent of local or national laws regarding inheritance. We verify your well-being through automated checks—if you don’t respond for a set period, the note is released to your heir. There’s no need for a death certificate or other legal paperwork.

  q4: 'How do you monitor if I’m still active, and what triggers the release of my data?'
  a4: |
    You define a “Pipeline” of actions in your account settings—this can include checking your “last seen” status on social media or sending you messages via email, WhatsApp, or SMS. If you fail to respond to these checks within the time intervals you choose, the system escalates through the next steps. Once all attempts fail, we assume you’re no longer available, and we send a link to your heir so they can try to decrypt your note.

  q5: 'Do I have to tell my heir in advance, or do they need an account?'
  a5: |
    No. You can add your heir’s contact details (email, phone, etc.) without informing them. They don’t need to sign up or do anything unless the system determines it’s time to release your note. At that point, they’ll receive instructions on how to decrypt it—by answering your custom security questions.

  q6: 'What if my heir doesn’t know the correct answers to the security questions?'
  a6: |
    If your heir can’t provide the exact answers, the note stays locked. We allow limited attempts—if none are successful, the data remains inaccessible. This design prevents unauthorized access and ensures only someone who truly knows your shared secrets can unlock your note.

  q7: 'How much does it cost, and what if I stop paying?'
  a7: |
    There is a small monthly fee (a few dollars per month) for continuous coverage. Think of it like an insurance policy for your digital assets. If you stop paying, your Pipeline will eventually be disabled after a grace period, and your secure envelope won’t be released to anyone.

  q8: 'Can I store multiple notes or large amounts of data?'
  a8: |
    Currently, each account is limited to one secure note (“envelope”). That note can contain up to 5,000 characters of text, which you can use to include any credentials, instructions, or messages you wish. If you want multiple notes, you’d need to register additional accounts.

  q9: 'What if I forget my security answers or lose my main password?'
  a9: |
    Your main password is just for logging into the service; losing it doesn’t automatically compromise your encrypted data. However, if you forget your security question answers, no one—including us—can ever decrypt your note, because we don’t store those answers anywhere. Always keep them safely in mind (or in a secure place).

  q10: 'Can I update my note, my heir’s details, or the Pipeline once it’s set up?'
  a10: |
    Absolutely. You can log into your dashboard at any time to edit your secure envelope (decrypt it first by providing your secret answers), change your heir’s contact information, or modify the Pipeline’s escalation steps. Any changes require you to re-encrypt your data, so remember your answers when updating.

note_creation:
  default_text: |
    Replace this text with your data:
    There are no limits to what you can enter here (though the field limit is 5000 characters). This could include crypto wallet credentials, online bank credentials, etc.
    This envelope will be encrypted with half of our security key and half of the hash from your answer to the security questions.
    Once encrypted, your answers will be deleted from our database, leaving only you and God with the knowledge required to decrypt this note.
    We will never save your answers again—all decryption will be done on the fly from the answers you provide when accessing the note.

if_decoded_can_edit: |
  If you succeeded in decrypting your text and you see the decoded text above, you can edit it right there.
  You can also edit your secret questions right here. 
  But don't forget to fill in all secret answers, as we need to encode this new version of your Envelope with every secret answer (and we never save them).
