      For security purposes, you can add up to 20 words in your answers — we will check if any of them match your 'Okay Password.'
      You can change your 'Okay Password' in the Edit Pipeline section.

    Replace this text with your data:
    There are no limits to what you can enter here (though the field limit is 5000 characters). This could include crypto wallet credentials, online bank credentials, etc.
    This envelope will be encrypted with half of our security key and half of the hash from your answer to the security questions.

    We will never save your answers again—all decryption will be done on the fly from the answers you provide when accessing the note.

  You can also edit your secret questions right here. 
  But don't forget to fill in all secret answers, as we need to encode this new version of your Envelope with every secret answer (and we never save them).
