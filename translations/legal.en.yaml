The Digital Heir is designed to allow users to safeguard digital assets and instructions in the event of their unavailability or passing.

  title: 'Refund Policy'
  description: 'Refund Policy page on “The Digital Heir"'
  date: 'Last Updated: March 6, 2025'

  1_title: '14-Day Money-Back Guarantee'

    If you have already triggered the “final release” of your Encrypted Note (i.e., The Digital Heir has deemed you inactive and delivered your information to your heir), we normally cannot grant a refund, as the core service has been fulfilled.

    Refunds are handled exclusively by Paddle as our Merchant of Record.
    If approved, refunds typically appear back in your account within 5–10 business days, depending on your payment method.

    If you do not recognize a Paddle charge or have a dispute, please contact Paddle first.
    Unwarranted chargebacks may result in a ban from future use of The Digital Heir, subject to Paddle’s dispute resolution process.
